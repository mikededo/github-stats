# github-stats

## Available commands

`github-stats` runs in an interactive shell where you can run commands that fetch Github data.

### Instructions

The application can be executed through a docker container, which simplifies its installation and usage. Run the following command in order to create a container that runs the image:

```sh
docker run \
-it --rm -v $(pwd)/output/:/output \
githubstats/github-stats:87
```

Some explanations are: 

- We use the `--it` param so that we can run the container in interactive mode. 
- We use the `--rm` param so that the container is deleted after execution.
- We also bind a volume to a host folder so that the output generated by the CLI can be stored in the host machine.

Once the application starts, you can run:

```sh
# to list all available commands
github-stats> help
# to know more about a command
github-stats> help <command-name>
```

Here's an example of an execution command:

```sh
# fetching information for github stats organization
github-stats> organization -n github-stats-22 -k <api-key> --from 11/22 --to 12/22 --path output/github-stats-22.csv
```

### CheckStyle

```sh
# compile the code
mvn clean site
```
